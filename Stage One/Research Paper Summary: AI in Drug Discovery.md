# Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives 
(J Jiménez-Luna)

The article reviewed the role of artificial intelligence in revamping the field of drug discovery and chemoinformatics. Addressed major obstacles and discussed future perspectives on the evolution of drug discovery with AI.
It discussed ligand and structure-based drug modeling, denovo drug design, and automated chemical synthesis. Highlighted the advantages and constraints of deep learning in drug development.

## **Key Highlights*

- Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly potent in automatically extracting features from data without explicit model training. AI 
  more sophisticated at handling complex, nonlinear data patterns unlike traditional machine learning methods.
- Another successful implementation of AI in areas is machine learning based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling 
  which aiming to provide better predictions of biological activity and pharmacokinetic parameters from complex chemical structure.
- There has been a significant surge in the use of AI for de novo drug design, with both rule-based and rule-free techniques being 
  investigated. Hybrid strategies that incorporate these approaches are emerging as potential options to successfully explore chemical 
  space. 
- Advanced natural language processing will enable further advancements in reaction prediction and automated synthesis modeling.
  
## **Challenges in Integration of AI with Drug Discovery*
- ### Data Quality and Availability
  AI models customized for massive data sets, which are typically limited, noisy or biased. This can impede the efficiency of AI 
  systems and lead to inaccurate predictions.
- ### Complexity of Chemical Space
  Using AI to develop novel compounds in the vast chemical space daunting task which demand high expertise in domain.
- ### Integration of Diverse Data Types
  It's challenging to integrate chemical, biological, and clinical data into coherent AI models.
- ### Explainability of AI Models
  Concerns about the interpretability of AI predictions impede adoption and validation by the scientific community.

## **Future Perspectives:*
- The authors envision a future when cutting-edge AI methods, such explainable AI and hybrid models, are commonplace in drug development.

- They hope to see more interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of trustworthy prediction models that function effectively 
  with less data

- It is anticipated that the Natural language processing and generative models together are expected to speed up synthesis planning and 
  enhance medication design.

In summary, the article indicates that optimizing artificial intelligence's potential to revolutionize drug discovery procedures would need tackling present obstacles.
